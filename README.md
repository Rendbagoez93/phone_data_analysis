- Trend analysis and visualization
- Predictive modeling for upcoming mobile devices
- Modular codebase for easy extension

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Recommended: Use a virtual environment

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd phone_data_analysis
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or, if using pyproject.toml
   pip install .
   ```

### Usage
- Run the main analysis script:
  ```sh
